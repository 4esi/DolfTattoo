# My First Live Website â€“ Version 1.0 

This is the first fully finished website I've built from scratch and made live!  
Itâ€™s a personal milestone for me as a beginner web developer.

## What I learned

While building this project, I learned a lot about:

- **HTML** structure and best practices
- **CSS** styling, layouts, and responsiveness
- **JavaScript** logic and interactions
- How to work with **project structure** and version control (Git)
- Planning and executing a complete website on my own

## Why it matters

This project helped me understand how different web technologies work together to create a real, usable product. Itâ€™s not perfect, but itâ€™s a big step forward â€” and Iâ€™m proud of it!

## Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Vanilla JavaScript
